# Release Gates

A stage passes only when: all critical (C) requirements are IMPLEMENTED with runnable test evidence; CI/local suites
genuinely green (commands, exit codes, counts recorded); zero unresolved Critical/High vulnerabilities (or a
human-signed risk acceptance — AI may not accept risk); tenant isolation verified; acceptance demo (E2E) passes; and the
**independent release-reviewer** was actually invoked with a fresh context and returned PASS. Medium/Low risks and
limitations are documented in KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md. We never claim "100% secure".

## Review template
`requirement_id | design_reference | code_reference | test_id | test_result/evidence | security_check | reviewer_verdict | open_issue`

## Gate log
| Stage | Date | Commit | QA evidence | Security evidence | Reviewer invocation | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | — | — | — | — | not yet invoked | INCOMPLETE | implementation in progress |

## Human actions required
- Enable branch protection on `main` requiring checks `api`, `web`, `e2e`, `security` and one review (repository settings → Branches).
- Sign any risk acceptance in this file with name, date and rationale.
