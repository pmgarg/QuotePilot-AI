# Known Limitations & Residual Risks (honest list; update every release)

## Stage 1 (current)
- Login rate limiter is in-process memory; horizontally scaled deployments need the Redis-backed limiter (Stage 2 runner adds Redis).
- OIDC/SSO not implemented; local accounts only. Member "invites" create local users with an admin-set initial password (no email).
- Parsers handle digitally readable documents only; scanned PDFs are flagged `unsupported_scanned` (OCR is an optional future component).
- The parser subprocess is isolated by interpreter flags and resource limits only; it runs as the API's OS user. Network and
  filesystem isolation (container, seccomp, read-only mounts) are deployment controls documented in the runbook.
- Fuzzy matching thresholds are heuristic, not calibrated; confidence is categorical by design.
- Unit conversion is alias normalisation only (no quantity conversion between units); mismatches require human confirmation.
- PDF branding is text-based (no logo upload yet); fonts limited to built-in Helvetica for determinism.
- No Docker daemon was available in the development container: `infra/docker-compose.yml` is written and linted but
  has not been executed end-to-end there; local PostgreSQL 16 was used for all recorded test evidence.
- Encryption at rest, TLS, backups and WAF are deployment responsibilities documented in the runbook.
- Multi-organization users are supported in the data model; the UI offers no org switcher yet.
- Medium: `npm audit` reports transitive `minimatch` advisories via `eslint-config-next` (dev-only tooling, not shipped).
- gitleaks and semgrep could not be run inside the development container (binary install blocked / registry rulesets
  need telemetry); both run in CI. A pattern-based secret grep ran locally as a fallback.
- Catalog header detection for import expects the header on the first row; RFQ spreadsheets may have the header lower.
- Quote PDFs are regenerated on download for drafts; approved PDFs are stored and byte-identical on repeat.

- Web CSP keeps `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` (Next.js inline runtime); a nonce-based policy is a follow-up.
- The login limiter is per API process (`--workers 2` doubles the budget); in the Docker topology all users share the
  web container's IP, so 10 wrong passwords for one address temporarily lock that address (5 min) — a deliberate
  brute-force trade-off until the Redis-backed limiter (Stage 2).
- `GET …/pdf` renders, stores (approved versions) and audits the download; the write is idempotent (same bytes/hash).
- Audit of `quote.update` records per-line pricing deltas (max 50 per save); description-only edits are summarised.
- Timing of login responses is equalised with a dummy Argon2 verification but not formally measured under load.

- Member creation answers 409 when an e-mail address is already registered on the platform (tenant admins can learn
  that an address exists). Accepted as Low pending a human product decision on an opaque invitation flow.
- Manual prices (custom lines or typed-over catalog prices) require an owner/admin confirmation with a reason before
  submission (policy adopted after review 1 finding M-4); approvers alone cannot clear that blocker.

## Stage 2–4
Not implemented; designs and backlogs exist (ROADMAP.md, PRD.md, LLD.md).
