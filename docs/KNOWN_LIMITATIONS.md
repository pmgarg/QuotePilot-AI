# Known Limitations & Residual Risks (honest list; update every release)

## Stage 1 (current)
- Login rate limiter is in-process memory; horizontally scaled deployments need the Redis-backed limiter (Stage 2 runner adds Redis).
- OIDC/SSO not implemented; local accounts only. Member "invites" create local users with an admin-set initial password (no email).
- Parsers handle digitally readable documents only; scanned PDFs are flagged `unsupported_scanned` (OCR is an optional future component).
- Fuzzy matching thresholds are heuristic, not calibrated; confidence is categorical by design.
- Unit conversion is alias normalisation only (no quantity conversion between units); mismatches require human confirmation.
- PDF branding is text-based (no logo upload yet); fonts limited to built-in Helvetica for determinism.
- No Docker daemon was available in the development container: `infra/docker-compose.yml` is written and linted but
  has not been executed end-to-end there; local PostgreSQL 16 was used for all recorded test evidence.
- Encryption at rest, TLS, backups and WAF are deployment responsibilities documented in the runbook.
- Multi-organization users are supported in the data model; the UI offers no org switcher yet.
- Medium: `npm audit` reports transitive `minimatch` advisories via `eslint-config-next` (dev-only tooling, not shipped).
- gitleaks and semgrep could not be run inside the development container (binary install blocked / registry rulesets
  need telemetry); both run in CI. A pattern-based secret grep ran locally as a fallback.
- Catalog header detection for import expects the header on the first row; RFQ spreadsheets may have the header lower.
- Quote PDFs are regenerated on download for drafts; approved PDFs are stored and byte-identical on repeat.

## Stage 2–4
Not implemented; designs and backlogs exist (ROADMAP.md, PRD.md, LLD.md).
